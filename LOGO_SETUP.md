# ELGCC Logo Setup Instructions

## Save Your Logo

Since I cannot directly download the logo image, please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Save the Logo
1. Right-click on the logo image you shared
2. Select "Save Image As..."
3. Save it as `elgcc-logo.png`

### Step 2: Add to Project
1. Navigate to: `C:\Users\trium\ELGCC\public\images\`
2. Copy your `elgcc-logo.png` file into this folder

### Alternative: Use Next.js Image Component
If you want better optimization, I can update the code to use Next.js Image component after you add the logo.

## What's Been Updated

The website now uses your brand colors:
- **Primary (Olive Green)**: #6B7F4C

The logo will appear in:

Once you add the logo file, the website will automatically display it!
